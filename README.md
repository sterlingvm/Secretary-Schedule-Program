# Secretary-Schedule-Program
This is a passion project I'm developing that is aimed to become a virtual assistant program that can be run on the terminal of your computer. Ideally, it can know and report the time-date-&amp;-weather, record-&amp;-manage your schedule, allow you to add-drop-&amp;-view your schedule events, receive schedule events through email using G-Suite APIs, and more!
